This app loads some data from a CSV file. The data contains a list of cities and countries with the number of days spent in each city and the average cost per day for each country.

I then make a call to two APIs to get information about that country, population and GDP. 

This then feeds into a machine learning algorithm which tries to predict average daily costs based on the population, GDP and number of days.
